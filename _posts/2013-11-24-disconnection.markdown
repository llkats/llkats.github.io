This past weekend, I went offline from Thursday night until Sunday afternoon for some mental space. Here is what I missed while I was disconnected:

### Things I Missed

* [chat.meatspac.es](chat.meatspac.es)
* easy distractions while riding Muni or waiting
* the instant gratification of reading new tweets/emails/instagrams/&c.

### Things I Didn't Miss

* constant notification assaulting my attention
* the latest Twitter drama du jour
* looking up a random fact RIGHT THIS SECOND
* not having any time to read

After a huge sprint at work, the internet was feeling more and more like an empty reward; I was depending on it too much for some sort of emotional connection and support. It was good to realize this and step away. I think I'll be reducing the number of notifications I receive on my phone and computer, which felt like the healthiest part of the break.

Instead of sinking time into mindless clicking, I read books, worked on a couple projects, had lunch with my aunt, and sat zazen twice. I even worked through some of a code book (learning the ins and outs of [Marionette](https://leanpub.com/marionette-gentle-introduction) for work) and was kept on track by the empty pie slice symbol of the disconnected Wifi in my taskbar.

And, in the end, I don't think I missed a whole lot. Though I am dying to get back on meatspace. Right after I finish this book.
