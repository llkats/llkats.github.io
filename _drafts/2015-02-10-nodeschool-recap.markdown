We had the inaugural event for the San Francisco chapter of NodeSchool this past Saturday. While NodeSchool events have been held in SF before, this event marked the first formal establishment of an SF-based chapter. As with any sort of event where one offers to help teach others, I ended up learning a lot as well. I was especially impressed with the self-organization of the event and its associated website, the initiative of both seasoned and beginning contributors, and the overall opportunities for involvement with the whole event.

## Opportunities for Involvement
- filing and organizing GitHub issues (clearest way for others to know what needs doing)
- designing the chapter's home website
- developing the website (relatively simply GitHub Pages flat site)
- writing and editing website copy
- organizing ticket signups
- running social media and outreach
- finding and reserving a venue
- supervising on the day of the event (coordinating with building management, making announcements, letting people know where the bathrooms are, enforcing the CoC, cleaning up afterwards, etc.)
- mentoring
- participating
- giving feedback
- improving documentation
- improving workshopper exercises

Some of these tasks involve knowledge of Git, GitHub, and general (mostly front-end) development knowledge. Others are fairly non-technical.
